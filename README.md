=============

Our main goals for this event are to familiarize ourselves with the Azure AI tools and gain more knowledge about the various tools available and how to effectively utilize them.

Throughout the hackathon, we aim to explore and understand the different tools offered by Azure AI. By immersing ourselves in these tools, we will not only expand our technical capabilities but also develop a deeper understanding of their functionalities, features, and potential applications.
